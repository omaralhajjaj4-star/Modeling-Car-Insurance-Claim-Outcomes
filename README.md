# Modeling-Car-Insurance-Claim-Outcomes
Working on behalf of the "On the Road" car insurance company, this project analyzes customer data to identify the single most predictive feature for insurance claims. The provided script uses the statsmodels library to systematically build a univariate logistic regression model for each variable in the dataset, predicting the outcome of a claim. After handling missing values by imputing the mean, the script evaluates each model's accuracy based on its confusion matrix. The final output identifies the single feature that produces the most accurate model, providing a clear, data-driven insight into the most significant factor for predicting claims.
