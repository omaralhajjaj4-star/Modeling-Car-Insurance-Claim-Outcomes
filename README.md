# Modeling-Car-Insurance-Claim-Outcomes
This project identifies the single best predictor of car insurance claims for the "On the Road" insurance company. Using Python and the Statsmodels library, it systematically builds and evaluates a logistic regression model for each customer feature to find the variable with the highest predictive accuracy.
